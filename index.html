          <li>In simple terms: CSS is like telling the computer how to decorate stuff on the page.
            Selectors are like pointing to the thing you want to decorate.
            Classes are like name tags for a group of things that all get the same decoration.</li>

          <li>A Function is a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task</li>
          <li>JavaScript is also a weakly-typed language, which means it allows implicit type conversion when an operation involves mismatched types, instead of throwing type errors</li>
